# PayCore

PayCore is a production-inspired payment gateway and settlement engine built as a Go backend systems project.

The long-term goal is to model high-throughput payment infrastructure with idempotent payment authorization and capture, Redis-backed admission control, PostgreSQL-backed durable state, Kafka lifecycle event publishing, settlement batch processing, and Prometheus observability.

## Goals

PayCore is designed to demonstrate:

- Payment authorization and capture workflows
- Payment holds and balance reservation
- Durable idempotency guarantees
- Redis-backed rate limiting and admission control
- Redis-backed idempotency response caching
- Optimistic concurrency control on payer balances
- Settlement batch processing and crash recovery
- Transactional outbox publishing
- Event-driven integration with LedgerFlow
- High-throughput API design and observability

## Current Status

Current development stage:

- Initial repository setup completed
- Go module initialized
- PayCore API service skeleton implemented
- Health, readiness, and version endpoints implemented
- Request ID middleware implemented
- Structured JSON request logging implemented
- JSON error response shape introduced
- HTTP API foundation tests added

Implemented endpoints:

```text
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
GET /version
```

Infrastructure such as PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus, Docker Compose, payment endpoints, settlement processing, and outbox publishing has not been implemented yet.

## Run Locally

Start the API server:

```bash
go run ./cmd/paycore-api
```

The API listens on port `8080` by default.

Override the address:

```bash
PAYCORE_HTTP_ADDR=:9090 go run ./cmd/paycore-api
```

Test the current endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl http://localhost:8080/readyz
curl http://localhost:8080/version
```

## Test

Run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```
